Project Title: Weighted Undirected Graph & Minimun Spanning Tree

Author: Gavin Chu, Kevin Xie, & Alan Kao

Description: 
	This project is two parts: 
1) Store a weighted undirected graph using two data structures: HashTable and LinkedList. Different data structures are used because certain structure is more efficient for accessing or changing the graph. For example it's better to find an edge or vertex using a HashTable, but finding the number of vertices in the graph would be more efficient to use a LinkedList that keeps track of the length.
2) Generate a minimun spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.

Instruction:
- Look at "WUGraph.java" and "Kruskal.java"
- Run "WUGTest.java" and "KruskalTest.java" to view test cases using the implementations in this project.
