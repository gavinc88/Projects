Project Title: Matrix Multiply Parallelization Using SSE Intrincis & OpenMP

Author: Gavin Chu & Kevin Xie

Description:
This projects is demonstrate the power of parallism computing. We focused on a simple
task of multiplying an extrememly large sized matrix by its transpose. Compared to the
naive implementation, our final solution performed about 50 times faster.

Instruction:
- look at "Makefile" for compile options (naive, small, openmp)
- "benchmark.c" provided for this project for testing runtime of matrix multiplication
