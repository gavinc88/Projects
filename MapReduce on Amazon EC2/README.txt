Project Title: MapReduce on Amazon EC2

Author: Gavin Chu

Description:
This project is a implementation of MapReduce. The task I was to complete
was: "given a word, what other words are statistically associated with it? 
If I say 'love', or 'death', or 'terrorism', what other words and concepts 
go with it?" 

I stored each word and distance of that word to the target word inside a hashmap.

Instruction:
- "Proj1.java" can be run on Amazon EC2 server
- "part-r-00000.filepart" contains a sample output
