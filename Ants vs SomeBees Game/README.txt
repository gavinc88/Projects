Project Title: Ants vs SomeBees Game

Author: Gavin Chu & Eric O'neil

Description: 
This project is a game similar to the popular game Plants vs. Zombies.
I implemented a variety of ants, each with a unique ability. The ants, 
for example "harvest ant" or "fire ant," inherits properties of a base
ant class. Similarly, I implemented a Bee class, which are the enemies 
of this game. In addition, I had to implement the interaction between 
the ants and bees and a game board (called colony).

Instructions:
- run "ants_gui.py" with Python 3
- the GUI was provided by my cs course
- I only implemented "ants.py"
- you can change game layouts/difficulties under the function "start_with_strategy()"
